# My vimfiles

My own Vimfiles. I tend to use vim-pathogen so plugins are easier to update.

# Features

* auto-identation, syntax highlight and all the basic stuff you would expect  
  from a decent text editor
* Pathogen for organizing vim plugins into it's own place
* Spelling with ,s and ,S to deactivate
* Strip whitespace on the end of lines for a set of filetypes
* Command + number and Command Arrows (I know, I'm a noob) to change tabs
* Ctrl-l inputs a => (i like this, specially when you map [capslock to ctrl](http://devlab.ca/?p=4188))
* A cool status bar
* Ruby syntax error detector! 
* shift visually selected block with tab and s-tab
